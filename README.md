# interpolation
The task was completed for the 'numerical methods' course. 
The task was to create a map showing the level of ionizing radiation - in an area of ​​10,000 m2 near a former nuclear power plant,
using data collected with a rover. The rover is equipped with a Geiger-Muller counter and can move the area taken along a given path, 
by measuring in discrete moments of time. Due to the harmful effect of radiation on measuring and navigational instruments, 
the measurement must be made quickly and in a small number of points. 
Therefore, an appropriate interpolation method had to be used to create an accurate map.![Zad1_K_14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45209419/162616014-c48bed52-a641-4d85-bc46-28e6d7c06377.png)
